# Polybar-Config
My first Polybar configuration on Linux.

Polybar is a popular and highly customizable status bar for Linux desktop environments. It is designed to sit at the top or bottom of the screen, providing users with important system information and notifications.

The Polybar configuration would be under `/config/polybar/`.

I created two scripts that i used for some functionalities of the bar, for example muting the mic,getting fan speed,getting mic volume...

Note:The file where the speed of fans gets storred can differ from a computer to another. You will have to look it up and change the path of it in the bash file fan_speed.sh

Note:If the icons didn't load try installing [Symbols Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

Note:Don't forget to make the bash files executable by using     <pre>chmod +x filename</pre>
